 *         If the variable is a byte, then any address.
 *         If the variable is a half-word, then an even address.
 *         If the variable is a word, then an address divisible by 4.
 *         This allows the resulting variable to be used with the relevant Flash_Write function which assumes a certain memory address.
 *         e.g. a 16-bit variable will be on an even address
 *  @param size The size, in bytes, of the variable that is to be allocated space in the Flash memory. Valid values are 1, 2 and 4.
 *  @return bool - TRUE if the variable was allocated space in the Flash memory.
 *  @note Assumes Flash has been initialized.
